% CTM Original:
The problem of scientific model selection has become increasingly more important to scientists in recent years, and at the same time has increased in difficulty.
This increase in difficulty is partially attributable to the increase in the number of models available, but a large part of the difficulty comes from the difficulty in gaining access to published models.
Restricting the search space of possible models to only those defined in source code still leaves researchers with many time consuming, tedious tasks in order to select which model best fits their needs.
These tasks include translating the models to a single source code language and common variable schema, validating the models with associated texts, analyzing the models with the correct statistical tools, and finally developing a criterion that determines which model is best for a given experiment.

In the work described above, I have show how to translate a portion of general Fortran source code into a programming language-agnostic GrFN representation that then permits analyses that allow for critical comparative insights to be gathered about models that that enable informed model selection.
The framework has been constructed to allow researchers to easily query results from the analysis of competing models when developing a criterion for selecting one model over another.
Additionally this framework is open to extension that will allow more of the tasks outlined above to be automated in future iterations.

\section{Future Work\label{sec:future_work}}
The AutoMATES project is developing a framework for the extraction and comparison of scientific models found in source code.
While many methods for analysis already exist in the AutoMATES system, as well as information necessary to facilitate automated model selection, there are a number of directions for future work.
Many of the opportunities for extending the AutoMATES system build upon one another, and all are focused on expanding the scope of modeler questions that AutoMATES is able to handle without additional input from the modeler.
In this section, I describe several extensions that can be made to the AutoMATES SMS pipeline.

\subsection{Variable Domain Detection\label{sec:var_domain_detection}}
One key issue that has not been addressed in this thesis so far is the issue of discovering the domain limitations of input variables in computation graphs.
Scientific models that are expressed in code are generally unlimited in terms of their functional form.
However certain mathematical functions place limits on the domains of variables used in their computation.
A classic example of this can be found in the source code for the PETASCE evapo-transpiration model:

\begin{equation}
  RHMIN = max\{20.0, min\{80.0, \frac{EA}{EMAX}*100.0\}\}
\end{equation}

From the above line we see that EMAX cannot equal zero.
That is a constraint upon the domain for EMAX; however, EMAX is not an input for the PETASCE model but is the result from a computation from inputs to the PETASCE model.
This shows that one task required for domain detection is for constraints from inner variables computed in a computational model, such as EMAX, to be propagated backwards to the input variables responsible for their computation.
This task is necessary for the analysis phase of the SMS pipeline, since a key portion of analysis is to sample over the domains of the inputs.
Choosing a sample that is out of the domain is detrimental to the SMS pipeline and currently the SMS pipeline requires defining the domains of variables by hand via hand-inspection of the source code.
Therefore the task of automatic variable domain detection is an immediately necessary next step to further complete the SMS pipeline.

\subsection{Model Selection via Uncertainty Analysis \label{auto_uncert_analysis}}
The current analysis methods employed by AutoMATES allow for automated model selection based upon behavior of model inputs or sets of model inputs. While these methods are likely desired by modelers, they only allow for indirect model comparisons. A method for direct comparison such as error propagation that includes an estimate of metrics such as variance in model output allows for stronger comparison statements that will likely be more acceptable metrics for automated model selection.

\subsection{Iterative Model Improvement\label{sec:auto_improve}}
After gathering enough information about various competing models as well as error information of model improvements,AutoMATES should be able to begin learning how to update models to lower uncertainty in model outputs.

A key component to this enhancement would be to identify similar function nodes or series of function nodes in a computation graph that correspond to the same overall computation. This, along with the grounding of variable nodes, which has been assumed, will enable modular computation components for variables to be added, removed, or mutated in order to improve model accuracy, efficiency, or other metrics of choice to modelers.

\subsection{Input Space Division\label{sec:auto_isd}}
Modelers would likely benefit from the AutoMATES being able to answer more general questions about what models to use to study a certain phenomena. For instance, modelers may not be able to provide bound information for the variables of interest to them when gathering data to study a particular phenomena. AutoMATES could assist modelers in this regard by discovering the furthest possible extent of all possible variables for each competing model of a phenomena and then partition the input variable space based upon peak model performance, such that each separate partition has an identified ideal model for studying the phenomena given inputs contained in that range. As previously stated the partition criterion would be some aspect of model fitness.

\subsection{Data Space Discovery\label{sec:auto_dsd}}
An extension of the idea of automatically discovering the input bounds of a set of input variables for a model is the idea of discovering the total possible data space for a phenomena of interest. Modelers would benefit from future versions of AutoMATES being able to identify potential additional variables for a given phenomena, other than just those identified by the modeler. A potential example would be the identification of a combination of variables that can be used to model a given model input with higher precision.
