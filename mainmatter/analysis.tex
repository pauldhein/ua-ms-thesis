\chapter{VARIATIONAL ANALYSIS OF MODEL UNCERTAINTY\label{chapter:analysis}}

The greatest benefit researchers receive from modeling is being able to reason about the uncertainty involved in observing a phenomena of choice. From the modeling perspective, explicit statements about the uncertainty of a phenomena can be made by adding inputs to the model of the phenomena that represent a source of variance upon the phenomena. A powerful tool used by modelers to quantify the uncertainty present in models is sensitivity analysis. Broadly speaking, sensitivity analysis is the study of how variance in the inputs of a model affect the variance, or uncertainty in the output of the model.

\section{Sampling Techniques\label{sec:samp_overview}}

Some text about the basic method for sampling from the inputs to a GrFN given little information.

\subsection{Saltelli Sampling\label{sec:saltelli_samp}}

This section should introduce Saltelli sampling and go into great detail on the process.

\subsection{Data Informed Sampling Techniques\label{sec:data_samp}}

This section should introduce the methods that we can use to sample from pre-existing data files associated with the codebase that we are working with.

\subsection{Grounded Sampling Techniques\label{sec:grounded_samp}}

This section should go into detail on how we can use the grounded nature of our variables to get information about how they exists in the real world that we can use to constrain the domains for our inputs.

\section{Sensitivity Analysis\label{sec:sensitivity_overview}}

Some text that discusses our methods for conducting Sensitivity analysis of our extracted GrFNs.

\subsection{Variance Based Analysis\label{sec:sobol_sensitivity}}

This section will go in depth on the Sobol method of Sensitivity analysis.


\section{Output Surface Analysis\label{sec:surface_analysis}}

This section will introduce the idea of generating output surfaces that scientists can view and interact with in order to better understand the sensitivity of their models based upon key inputs. The choice in which surfaces to show will be directed by sensitivity analysis.
