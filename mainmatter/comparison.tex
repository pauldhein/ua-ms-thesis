\chapter{AUTOMATED MODEL COMPARISON\label{chapter:comparison}}

Some intro about the task of comparing two or more GrFN models that have been extracted from source code.

\section{Variable Node Identification\label{sec:var_ident}}

Some text about the task of unifying variable nodes that may have different names but represent the same physical variable.

\section{Common Subnetwork Isolation\label{sec:subnet_iso}}

Some text about identifying the Forward Influence Blanket of two or more models that isolates the shared components of two models in a markov blanket that allows for forward inference.

\section{Unrelated Subgraph Diff\label{sec:unrelated_diff}}

Some text that discuss the challenges and our solutions for comparing the subcomponents of two GrFNs that do not share any information in common.
