% There are five copyright options.  Copyright, no copyright, and three
% different Creative Commons licences.  Use the one you want (If you go
% Creative Commons, I (DM) think the CC-BY-ND makes the most sense)  See
% uathesis.cls for the reason why the non-commercial licenses are not
% included.

% Package Usage
% These are the packages that we need
%\usepackage{algorithm}
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
\usepackage[ruled,boxed,noend]{algorithm2e}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{natbib}
% natbib is available on most systems, and is terribly handy. If you want to use a different Bibliography package, you should be able to, just change this and the \bibliographystyle command below. Be warned that you may need to do a little hacking to get the REFERENCES item to show up in your TOC.

% Compatibility with the AASTEX package of the American Astronomical Society.
%\usepackage{deluxetable}		% Allows use of AASTEX deluxe tables
%\usepackage{aastex_hack}		% Allows other AASTEX functionality.

% These are other packages that you might find useful.
% For controlling the fonts, see http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~hartke/computer/latex/survey/survey.html

% The following is a nice font set:
%\usepackage{mathtime}			% Times for letters; Belleek math.
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}			% AMS Math (advanced math typesetti`ng)
%\usepackage{lscape}			% Used for making fitting large tables in by putting them landscape
%\usepackage{refs}

% If you are using hyper-ref (recommended), this command must go after all
% other package inclusions (from the hyperref package documentation).
% The purpose of hyperref is to make the PDF created extensively
% cross-referenced.
\usepackage[bookmarks,colorlinks=true,urlcolor=black,linkcolor=black,citecolor=black]{hyperref}
